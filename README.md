# WaydroidAutoClick
A scriptable auto click for multiple android games

Works with Wayland, X11.

Use ADB to send command, mouse click,  get screenshot, etc.
Doesn not focus mouse so you are free to do other things while auto clicking

GameScript directory holds all game scripts, you can extend this catalog with your own script ( it s literraly bash script )
For now, only one script for the Tower idle game.

don t hesitate to submit your script for any games !
